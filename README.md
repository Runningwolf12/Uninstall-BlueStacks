Uninstall BlueStacks for Mac OS X
=================================

**the missing uninstaller**

-----

#### NOTICE	#
This project as been moved to [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/osxbluestacksuninstaller/) and has been depreciated. Unless there are [bug reports](https://github.com/danijeljames/Uninstall-BlueStacks/issues/new), it will not longer receive updates and remain as a `FINAL` build.  
  
**DMG:** 1.4.1  
**Script:** 1.5.0

-----

Simply does what it says - removes BlueStacks completely from Mac OS X for you. No effort required on your behalf!  
  
Comes in 2 flavours, the bash script and the Application. Personally, I prefer the bash script because it's smaller and faster. I'm all about efficiency. Either way, you're free to choose what's easier for you. 

#### Installation #
Download to the `/usr/bin` directory _(requires **cURL** and **sudo**)_:
````
sudo curl "http://sourceforge.net/p/osxbluestacksuninstaller/code/ci/master/tree/RemBlueStacks.sh?format=raw" -o "/usr/bin/RemBlueStacks.sh" && sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/RemBlueStacks.sh
````
Alternatively, download the [DMG](http://sourceforge.net/projects/osxbluestacksuninstaller/files/1.4.1/UninstallBlueStacks.dmg/download) from SourceForge and run the application instead.

#### Usage #
Via Terminal _(assuming you installed it as mentioned above)_:
````
sudo RemBlueStacks.sh
````
